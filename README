This project should work with kannel as :
	http smsc ,with allowed smsc = sncheck_linkXX, queue_linkXX
	take messages and do proper mangle i.e change sender and then resend it again to origin link through the orign smsbox (should take the proxy-smsbox and proxy send-sms user setting from kannel.conf)

Sample proxy config
	1. main conf
	2.conf dir
	(i.e linkXX.conf)
		allowed-senders = "sender1;sender2;sender3;"
		mangled-sender = "SMS" # applied when not match any of above.
